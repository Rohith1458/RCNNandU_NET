This project RCNN and U-Net models for ultrasound nerve segmentation, focusing on accurately identifying and segmenting nerve structures in ultrasound images. The RCNN model leveraged region-based convolutional neural networks for object detection, while the U-Net model utilized a convolutional network architecture for precise segmentation. This project significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of nerve segmentation in medical imaging.
